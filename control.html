            <h1>Concept Of Control</h1>
            <p>Concept Of Control
             Control can be used in negative ways such as through the use of manipulation to force others to behave in a certain way. Which can lead to feelings of resentment and disempowerment and can damage relationships.
             The concept of control needs to be balanced with the principles of respect and collaboration. Healthy sense of control involves empowering individuals to make choices and take ownership of their actions.
             Control should be exercised in a way that promotes collaboration and teamwork. At last, concept of control is complex and multifaceted and can be both beneficial and harmful. 
             It is essential to balance between control and autonomy and to use control in a way that empowers and supports individuals.

            <h3>Types Of Control Systems</h3>
            <h4>Pre-Control</h4>
            <p>It attempts to monitor the quality and quality of financial, human and informal resources before they actually become part of the system.
                Control take place before operation and free forward control. Also to reduce problem.
                Pre-control is a concept of management and quality control that involves taking preventive measures to ensure that a process or system operates effectively. 
                The objective of pre-control is to make a stable process that produces consistent and high-quality results. It involves understanding the variables that affect the process and establishing controls that prevent these variables. 
                This can be accomplished through a variety of techniques like (SPC)statistical process control , process mapping and (FMEA)failure mode and effects analysis .
                SPC is a statistical method used to monitor and control a process by analyzing data and identifying variations. SPC involves establishing a system for collecting data to ensure that the process remains within acceptable limits.
            </p>
            <h4>Concurrent control system</h4>
            <p>It is control during action phase.
             Concurrent control system is a concept in management and quality control that involves monitoring and adjusting a process in real time. This asystem allows for immediate corrective action to be taken or preventing defects and errors from occurring.
             Concurrent control systems are often used in complex processes where errors or deviations can have a significant impact on the final product. Concurrent system can include manufacturing processes, software development and project management.
             Concurrent control systems can be implemented using a variety of techniques like statistical process control, automated feedback systems and manual inspection. This specific system used will depend on the nature of the process and the desired outcome.
              concurrent control system will reduced defects and errors detecting and correcting errors in real time and it also can help to reduce the number of defects or errors. Concurrent control system improved process efficiency continuously monitoring and adjusting the process which can help to improve process efficiency and reduce waste.
             concurrent control system is faster problem resolution providing immediate feedback and allowing for real-time process adjustment and also help to resolve problems.
            </p>
            <h4>Post-Control</h4>
            <p>It examines what has happened in a particular pend in past. Historical control.
            Most common reactions to post-control is fatigue. Exerting control over oneself or situation can be mentally and physically taxing leading to a feeling of exhaustation. It can be particularly called in situations where a person has had to exert a great deal of effort to maintain control and resisting a strong temptation or enduring a difficult task.
            Common post-control reaction is a sense of accomplishment. When a person successfully insert control over a situation it can lead to a sense of pride and satisfaction. It can be powerful motivator for further self-control efforts as it reinforces the idea that control is achievable and worthwhile.
