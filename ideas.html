                <h1>Here you can get ideas to invest in company.</h1>
                     
                <p>I am here to share the idea of investing.
                     Before starting idea of investing I want to say introduction myself. 
                     I am not an big of successful investor but I have pretty good knowledge that I can share with everyone.

                    I always want to share knowledge whatever  I have gain in my whole life. 
                    There is saying that "the more you share ,more you gain" that's why I want to share my gain knowledge.
                    
                    
                    Investing is literally easy game for those people who have eager to learn. 
                    You have to control the emotion while selling and buying the stocks.  </p>
                <br>
                   <p> Thing before buying and selling stock.  Warren Buffett said "rule number 1 don't loose money and rule number 2 is don't forget rule number 1". 
                     Buy when others are fearful, sell when others are  greedy. Warrant Buffett is all time greatest investor. 
                     Before investing  we need to check <a href="investing.html">netincome</a> condition of company . After checking all condition of company then only we can decide the it is good company or not.  How much easy its seems but that much it isn't . 
                     Bring lots of headaches. We will go in details about investing. I will try to clarify you about investing and
                     you also can invest in company.
                     </p>

                     <p>Before investing you need think why I am investing in this company. 
                        Invest in that company which you understand  properly.
                         If you are investing in company then invest for more then 10 years. Then  you can get good return. 
                        Don't  go for short term investing . </p>
