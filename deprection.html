            <h1>What is Deperciation?</h1>
            <p>It's iThe word 'depreciation' has been derive from  Latin word'depretium'which means decline in price or value of assets.
              It's also known as decerese in value of assets due to natural causes,tear,wear or decrese in market value.The reduction of value 
              each year is known as loss.Therefore it is accounted in firm's books of accounts. <br> Assets account will be debited by interest and other will be credited by depreciation in every year until
              the value of assets come to zero or its salvage value. </p>
           </div>
             
           <div class="form">
            <img src="Depreciation.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Formula</h3>
            <p>We can see at the figure how to calculate depreciation.Before calculating depreciation we need 
            cost of assets, salvage value and useful life of that assets. F11ormula +of depreciationis Cost
          of assets substract salvage value and divide it with useful life of asset value.Then, we will get
        depreciation. </p>

            <h4>Cost of assets</h4>
            <p>Its represents the monetary costs involved in installing, acquaring and commissioning assets.
              We need to known what is the orginal value of assets and adding the other installing expenses.Including all
              costswe can find cost of assets.</p>

              <h5>Salvage Value</h5>
              <p>
                It is the book value of an assets after including all depreciation.
                Salvage value is an asset based on selling the asset at the end of useful life.</p>

                <h6>Uselful Life Of Assets</h6>
                <p>The period over which asset is available for entity or number of year it is likely available for 
                  service.
